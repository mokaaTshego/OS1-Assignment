Dear Marker

Here is my appproach for the assignment.

- Used the first seven entries
-Page number is 32bits
-using the page number I calculated the offset, which is the remainder of the page size after removing the page number
-After I looked at where the offset is in memory using the frame tables
-then used the frame entry to get the address at physical memory
-Then added the offset to physical memory
